        <div class="content has-text-justified">
We show that physics-based simulations can be seamlessly integrated with NeRF to generate high-quality elastodynamics of real-world objects. Unlike existing methods, we discretize nonlinear hyperelasticity in a meshless way, obviating the necessity for intermediate auxiliary shape proxies like a tetrahedral mesh or voxel grid. A quadratic generalized moving least square (Q-GMLS) is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation. As a result, physically realistic animations can be conveniently synthesized using our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials at an interactive rate.

## Pipeline

![](/static/image/pipeline.pdf)

*The input of PIE-NeRF is the same as other NeRF-based frameworks, which consists of a collection of images of a static scene. An adaptive Poisson disk sampling is followed to query the 3D geometry of the model, which are sparsified into $n$ Q-GMLS kernels. Integrator points are placed over the model, including centers of Q-GMLS kernels (i.e., kernel IPs). Discretization at kernels and numerical integration at IPs enable efficient synthesis of novel and physics-based elastodynamic motions. The quadratic warping scheme helps to better retrieve the color/texture of a deformed spatial position to render the final result.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., œÄ, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., ‚àö2, ‚àõ3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., ‚àö2 + ‚àö3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
